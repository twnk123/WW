        question: 'What does "AI-driven, multi-agent pipeline" mean?',
        answer: 'It means we use a series of specialized AI agents that handle different stages of developmentâ€”from research and creating specifications to writing and deploying code. This automates the repetitive parts of software development, making the process faster and more efficient.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Who owns the code that you produce?',
        answer: 'You do. All intellectual property and code generated for your project is 100% owned by you. We provide clean, scalable, and well-documented code that your team can build upon.'
    },
    {
        question: 'How quickly can you deliver a project?',
        answer: 'Our automation studio compresses months of traditional product work into days or weeks, depending on the project\'s complexity. We can deliver an MVP significantly faster than a typical agency.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What kind of technologies do you use?',
        answer: 'We are technology-agnostic and use the best tools for the job. Our expertise includes modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and Vue, as well as robust backend technologies. The core of our process is our proprietary prompt engineering and agentic coding framework.'
